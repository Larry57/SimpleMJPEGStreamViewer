#SimpleMJPEGStreamViewer

This simple MJPEG streams viewer is a proof to myself that MJPEG stream decoding can be accomplished using bare C# bricks and a naive, **very easy to adapt** implementation.

The core is the *SimpleMJPEGDecoder.cs* class which is available as is, separately [in a Gist.](https://gist.github.com/Larry57/958bd61252a3f810b75d)

**I am still looking for a way to decode the more MJPEG streams I could at the same time**, and posted [a question on CodeReview](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/123394/bare-bone-c-mjpeg-stream-decoder-implementation) regarding this.
